# ebay-scraper
## Description of my ebay-scraper code: 
My code is meant to find the following information for products sold on ebay and put this information in a json file. The json file includes information on the product name, price, condition of product, shipping price, number of items sold, and whether there are free returns for the product. 
## Running the code: 
To run the code I used the following command: 

```
ptyhon3 ebay-dl.py 'item name' --num_pages=10
```

To download `hammer.json` I used the following code: 

```
